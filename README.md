WebSET (Website Security Evaluation Tool) is a python based vulnerability scanner designed to identify OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilits for both JavaScript and HTML.

WebSET is a web application penetration testing tool designed to allow developers easy access to scanning and enumeration for critical intrinsic vulnerabilities in their codebases. WebSET enables developers access to localised white-box penetration testing that can be utilised at any stage during or after development to identify the most common vulnerabilities and receive recommendations on how to mitigate them.

By providing a single platform to encompass what are typically independent test cases, our WebSET prototype enables a scalable and automatable framework with the capacity to ingest more vulnerability databases and provide customised recommendations.
