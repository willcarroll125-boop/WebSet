WebSET (Website Security Evaluation Tool) is a python based vulnerability scanner designed to identify OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilits for both JavaScript and HTML.

WebSET provides developers to perform targeted security testing directly within their development environment. Vulnerability detection is simplified by combining multiple testing capabilities into a single, automated framework. The tool can be applied during or after development to reveal high-risk weaknesses and generate clear remediation advice

- Injection
- Broken Access Control
- Cryptographic Failures
- Insecure Design
- Security Misconfiguration
- Identity and Authentication Failures
- Software and Data Integrity Failures
- Vulnerable and Outdated Components
- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
- Security logging and Monitoring Failures

**System Requirements**
- Python 3.10+

**Installation and Launch Process**
